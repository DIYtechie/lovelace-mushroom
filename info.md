# Mushroom DIY template card

Mushroom DIY is a fork of [piitaya/lovelace-mushroom](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom)
that keeps the new template card aligned with the classic Mushroom theme variables.
It ships the built `mushroom.js` bundle that HACS installs as a Lovelace plugin.

## Installation

Use [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) and add the repository as a custom Lovelace plugin,
or download `mushroom.js` from the latest release and place it in `config/www`.

The loaded release writes its version to the browser console. You can also confirm it by running
`window.mushroomDIYVersion` in the browser developer tools.
